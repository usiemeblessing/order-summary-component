## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the order summary component centered on the page

-   See hover states for interactive elements (e.g., buttons and links)

-   Switch to a different plan (if the button was functional — though this is static in the basic version)

-   View a responsive layout on smaller screens

## My process

I started by setting up the basic HTML structure, focusing on semantic elements. Then, I styled the component using CSS, paying close attention to spacing, typography, and alignment to match the design. I used Flexbox for centering and layout. Finally, I added responsive styling to ensure it looks good on smaller screens.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

-   How to structure a simple component using semantic HTML

-   Using Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally

-   Applying consistent spacing, font styles, and colors based on a design

-   Making a layout responsive for different screen sizes

-   Improving attention to detail by closely matching a given design

### Continued development

I’d like to keep improving my skills in responsive design, especially using mobile-first workflows. I also plan to explore adding basic interactivity with JavaScript in future projects and focus more on accessibility best practices to make my components more user-friendly.
